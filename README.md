Coding is terrible because it is a ton of bullshit. Everyone acts like they know what they are doing but the reality is that apparently everyone really only thinks they know what they are doing. 

We should treat is the same as medicine and instead of claiming we know how to code, we should never take more credit than for the act of practicing to code.
